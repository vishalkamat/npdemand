# npdemand: Python package for nonparametric analysis of counterfactual demand

This Python package implements the tools in Kamat and Norris (2022) to evaluate the average willingness to for a price decrease as well as the effect on demand of a general price change in the presence of exogenous, discrete variation of prices. 

It allows for three specification of demand: (i) nonparametric demand with only assuming demand for an alternative increases with the price of other alternatives; (ii) specification (i) along with additionally imposing that demand is separable; and (iii) specfication (ii) along with additionally imposing that demand is parameterized to be polynomial of degree K in each price.

Confidence intervals are constructed using the procedure from Bugni et al. (2018)
